These examples cover some of the basics of HTML, CSS, SVG:

* svg_examples.html -- Some examples of using SVG elements, transforms etc.  Note that there's an (intentional) example of style specificity rules.  The three grouped circles are not green because the circle style in style.css overrides the group style
* style.css -- some basic style specifications for svg_examples
* index.html -- a basic boilerplate HTML file, that you can include a javascript file with, either l03a or l03b
* l03a.js -- basic function experimentation
* l03b.js -- class declarations with functions
